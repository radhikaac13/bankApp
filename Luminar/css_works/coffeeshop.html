            <p>Many people kickstart their day with a hot cup of strong coffee to feel active throughout the day. However, coffee isn’t a new phenomenon and has been around for over a thousand years. But do you know which country grows the most coffee in the world or that it is of two main types?</p>

            <h3>here are some interesting facts about cofee,according to coffee culture</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                   <h4>Coffee was discovered in 800 AD</h4> 
                   <p>Legend has it that 9th-century goat herders noticed the effect caffeine had on their goats, who appeared to “dance” after eating the fruit of the coffea plant. A local monk then made a drink with the produce and found that it kept him awake at night, which was the original cup of coffee!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4> Beans? No, they are actually seeds!</h4>
                    <p>They’re the pits of the cherry-like berries found on the flowering shrubs, but we call them “beans” because of their resemblance to legumes. And you can also eat coffee cherries as a food. Early on, people mixed coffee berries with fat to create an energy-rich snack ball, according to PBS. They would also ferment the pulp to make a wine-like drink.</p>
                </li>
